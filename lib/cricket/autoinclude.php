// I've studied both PSR-0 and PSR-4 both baffle me.  
// PHP already has the include_path.   Just map the namespace to
// a file system path that would be relative the "include_path" and 
// let it rip.
//
// I'm not a fan of PSR-0 because of the legacy _ mapping issues
// I'm not a fan of PSR-4 because I can't know for sure what class is loading based on the
// namespace...  plus it it doesn't seem to help the "standards" since it doesn't define
// a method of mapping vendor prefixes to directories.
//
// I'm happy to consider using PSR-4 if someone can explain the win to me.
// Having said all that, I believe that this autoloader should play nicely with others.
